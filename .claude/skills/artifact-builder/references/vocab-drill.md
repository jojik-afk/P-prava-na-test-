# Vocabulary Drill (Type B)

Always FR↔CZ. Build all four sections below — do not omit any.

---

## Sections to Build

### 1. Word List / Glossary
- Categorised vocabulary cards with emoji icons
- Each card shows: FR term + CZ translation
- For **colour vocabulary:** include actual colour swatches alongside the words
- Make the glossary browsable before exercises begin — it doubles as a study reference

### 2. Exercise Modes (build ALL four)

| Mode | How it works | Key rules |
|---|---|---|
| **Multiple choice** | Select correct translation from options | Standard single-select feedback per Quiz Engine Spec in `base.md` |
| **Write-the-word** | User types the FR or CZ translation | Accept flexibly: ignore missing/extra articles, accept with or without diacritics, accept valid synonyms. **No easy hints** — see rules below |
| **Sentence translation** | Translate full sentences, both FR→CZ and CZ→FR | Build sentences from the target vocabulary; cover relevant grammar (near-future with aller + infinitif, weather in context, clothing descriptions) |
| **Matching / Pairing** | Match FR terms to their CZ translations | Click-to-select pairs or drag-and-drop |

### 3. Score & Progress
- Per-category percentage breakdown (e.g. "Oblečení: 8/10")
- Overall score across all categories
- Motivational end-of-quiz messages — use the thresholds from the Quiz Engine Spec in `base.md`

### 4. Sentence Section
- Contextual sentences built from the target vocabulary
- Cover the grammar structures relevant to the topic:
  - Clothing vocab → sentences describing outfits, packing for weather
  - Body / health → describing symptoms, doctor visit dialogue
  - Weather → forecasts, seasonal descriptions
  - Near-future tense → aller + infinitif in realistic scenarios

## Specific Rules (enforced)

- **Hints on write exercises:** Do NOT give easy hints. No first-letter giveaways. Either remove hints entirely or make them cryptic (e.g. hint = number of syllables, or a vague semantic category).
- **Navigation bar:** Use the colour-coded question dot bar from the Quiz Engine Spec in `base.md`. **No legend below it.**
- **Answer matching:** Be generous. Accept the answer as correct if:
  - The user omits or adds an article (e.g. "chaud" accepted for "le chaud")
  - Diacritics are missing or wrong (e.g. "été" accepted as "ete")
  - A valid synonym is used
  - Capitalisation differs
